# Modding_Icarus
Mods for the Icarus game

Having issues, look for me on the Linkarus-Icarus Modding discord, user Globeadue

A lot of framework of my mods are based off the work of the others of this discord, thank you for paving the road for me.

Some mods are more polished than others and I consider them all works in progress.


Known Issues:
Husk Epoxy needs to be unlocked by completing the husk quest, right now no restrictions
some packages of crop plots still have all perks from when I was testing, when fixed, all the seed packet crop plots will only have a couple of the perks
WorkshopAttachmentSlots is currently unpublished as it's a work in progress, not all items are currently assigned attachment slots

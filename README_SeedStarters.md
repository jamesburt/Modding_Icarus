Globeadue Seed Starts
Ever want to land on planet and just be able to startup the garden right away? This mod is the answer.

Completely reimages the seed packet tree in the workshop.
I broke the the rows of the tree up into 5 Tiers, starting the bottom, Tier 1 to 5.
I catagories the seeds as fruits/vegies and stable(ie do not decay).
Tier 1: A seed packet containing a few of the plants from hot and cold areas.
Tier 2: Seed packets: Fruit Packet, veg Packet and a Stable packet. These packes contain a few of each of the seeds from that catagory.
Tier 3: Deluxe packets: these contain a few concrete slabs, farm plots for all of the seeds and pillars along with the corresponding tier 2 seed packet.
Tier 4: Farm Kit: this expensive pack contains a bunch of food prepartation deploysables along with a deluxe packet of each of the 3 seed packets. You'll be able to setup functional farmworks within minutes of landing.
Tier 5: Open world seed packet containing 2 of each of the four open world plants.
